## Description

A website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc.), a size to order a pizza, and see the final cost.

### Objectives (MVP)

* Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.
* Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.
* Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen.
Additionally:
* Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.
* Application works as expected.
* Tests are included for each business logic behavior and code is committed after each test passes.
* Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.
* The promptâ€™s required functionality and baseline project requirements are in place by the deadline.

## Tests
```
Describe: Pizza()

Test: "It should return a Pizza object with two properties for toppings and size"
Code: const myPizza = new Pizza(["anchovies", "pineapple"], "medium");
Expected Output: Pizza { toppings: ["anchovies", "pineapple"], size: "medium" }

Describe: Order()

Test: "It should return an empty Order object with two properties for items and currentId"
Code: 
const myOrder = new Order()
Expected Output: Order { items: {}, currentId: 0}

Describe: Order.prototype.getId()

Test: "It should return a unique id by incrementing current id by one"
Code: 
const myOrder = new Order()
myOrder.getId();
Expected Output: 1

Describe: Order.prototype.addItem()

Test: "It should return an Order object that contains a Pizza object nested within the items property"
Code: const myPizza = new Pizza(["anchovies", "pineapple"], "medium");
const myOrder = new Order()
myOrder.addItem(myPizza);
myOrder;
Expected Output: Order { items: { id: 1; toppings: ["anchovies", "pineapple"], size: "medium" ), currentId: 2}

Describe: Pizza.prototype.getPrice()

Test: "It should return the price of a small pizza"
Code: const myPizza = new Pizza([], "small");
myPizza.getPrice();
Expected Output: 8

Test: "It should return the price of a medium pizza"
Code: const myPizza = new Pizza([], "medium");
